Website for Bono Estate, a family-run, traditional olive oil producer.

Initial Figma prototype created for client approval ([https://bit.ly/3s5g5Yt](https://bit.ly/3s5g5Yt)), site built using Ruby (v2.7.3) on Rails (v6.0.4) with Node (v14.18.3) and deployed to Heroku ([https://bono-estate.herokuapp.com/](https://bono-estate.herokuapp.com/)). Code on GitHub ([https://github.com/RobMRowe/bono-estate](https://github.com/RobMRowe/bono-estate)).

Currently employs PostgreSQL database, with a view to potential expansion and webstore implemention in future.

N.B. Site not yet officially launched due to client's other commitments; version currently on Heroku is pending further development/pre-release.
